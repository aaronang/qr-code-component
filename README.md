# QR Code Component

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

Observations from working on the QR Code component:

- What are the best practices for vertically centering content?
- It was quite difficult to replicate the design without having access to the design file.
- Tailwind seemed to have gained a lot of attention but I haven't quite figured out why.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and recommendations on how to improve this.
